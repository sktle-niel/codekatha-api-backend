# CODEKATHAX API — Security notes & deploy checklist

This API is bearer-token based (no cookies), uses prepared statements throughout,
hashes passwords with bcrypt, stores visitor IPs only as salted hashes, and gates
every admin/agent action behind a server-side session check. The items below are
the **deployment / configuration** steps that the code cannot enforce on its own.

## Before going live (do all of these)

1. **Lock CORS to your real domain.** In the production `.env`, set
   `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the exact frontend origin(s), never `*`:
   ```
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://codekathaxinquires.vercel.app
   ```
   With `*`, the Origin check on state-changing requests is skipped.

2. **Set a strong `IP_SALT`.** Replace the placeholder with a long random secret
   (used to hash visitor IPs for rate limiting). Generate one with:
   ```
   php -r "echo bin2hex(random_bytes(32));"
   ```
   Never reuse the default `ckx-local-dev-salt-change-me`.

3. **Force HTTPS.** Serve the API only over TLS and redirect HTTP → HTTPS in
   hPanel / `.htaccess`. Bearer tokens must never travel over plain HTTP. The app
   already sends `Strict-Transport-Security` once the request is HTTPS.

4. **Turn off error display.** In production `php.ini` (or hPanel):
   ```
   display_errors = Off
   log_errors = On
   ```
   All errors are already caught and logged; clients only get generic messages.

5. **Protect secrets & uploads.**
   - `.env` lives outside `public/` and is git-ignored — keep it that way and
     restrict its file permissions (e.g. `600`).
   - `public/uploads/` holds client images; its `.htaccess` disables code
     execution. This relies on **Apache** (Hostinger shared hosting). If you ever
     move to nginx, replicate the "no script execution in uploads" rule.

6. **Run all migrations** in `database/migrations/` in order (001 → 010) on the
   production database.

## Built-in protections (already in the code)

- **Auth:** opaque 256-bit tokens stored only as SHA-256 hashes; sliding 30-day
  sessions; live status re-check so suspended agents lose access immediately.
- **Authorization:** every admin endpoint sits behind `ckx_require_admin`; agent
  endpoints are scoped to the session's own agent (no cross-account access).
- **Rate limits:**
  - Login: 10 failed attempts / 15 min **per IP** + 10 / 15 min **per account**.
  - Project form: 8 / hour + 20s min gap per IP, plus a honeypot.
  - Agent signup: 2 / day per IP, plus a honeypot.
  - Public tracker (`status.php`): 60 lookups / minute per IP.
- **Injection/XSS:** prepared statements everywhere; email HTML escapes all
  user-supplied values.
- **Uploads:** MIME allow-list (JPG/PNG/WebP) + `getimagesize` check + random
  filename + forced extension + execution-blocked folder; max 5 images, 5 MB each.
- **CSRF:** bearer tokens (not cookies) + JSON-only + Origin allow-list on writes.
- **Headers:** `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`,
  `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` (over HTTPS).

## Optional future hardening

- Two-factor auth for the owner account.
- Move rate limiting to a cache (APCu/Redis) if traffic grows, to avoid DB writes
  on hot paths.
